# Coding Exercise Prompt

## Task
Use the GitHub REST API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference) to create a simple application that retrieves and displays information about
GitHub organizations.

## Requirements
* The web app should start on a page that displays a list of 10 GitHub Organizations
  * The list is sorted by name
  * The user is able to load additional list items (i.e. next page, lazy loading, load more button)
  * Each list item shows some basic info, like name, avatar, etc.
* When a user taps on an organization in the list, the web app navigates to a second page that displays more in-depth information about
the Organization
  * The content should load again when the page is refreshed
* Written in JavaScript or TypeScript and implemented with React
* This exercise is meant to be broad. Consider code architecture, navigation, user experience, and visual components. Nothing is off
limits.

## Additional Information
* 3rd party libraries are fine, but be prepared to explain why you chose them!
* Show us what you can do! Think of this exercise as an opportunity to share your opinions on architecture, patterns, and best practices
that you’ve gained from past experience.
* Leave comments in your code if there is something you would like us to know while reviewing it.
* We don’t want you to spend too much time on this exercise. If you would have liked to implement more functionality, please just write a
quick README or not that outlines improvements or changes you would incorporate given more time.
* When you are finished, please share a link to your codesandbox, Github repository, or zip of your files and email them to your recruiter.

## Setup Instructions
We recommend using Codesandbox (https://codesandbox.io) to easily start a React project and share a working sample, but feel free to create a
project locally and share the result via a GitHub public repo or zipped files instead.
